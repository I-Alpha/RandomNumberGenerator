Implement a method Generate() and a minimal but effective set of unit tests (can use any testing framework). 

For example, called with Random Numbers [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3] and Probabilities [0.01, 0.3, 0.58, 0.1, 0.01], after calling the method 100 times 

a similar result set should be created (as results are RANDOM, these particular results are unlikely): 



-1: 1 time(s)

 0: 22 time(s)

 1: 57 time(s)

 2: 20 time(s)

 3: 0 time(s) 



You may only use Random().NextDouble()  which returns a pseudo random number between 0 and 1.

Signature of the method: 

public int Generate(int[] numbers, float[] probabilities)



Once the task is completed, put the implementation and tests in a single file and upload it.
